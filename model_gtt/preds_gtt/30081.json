  "doctext": "good evening . i have called this news conference to read a foreign ministry com ##mun ##ique : ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) today the panama ##nian government told luis sand ##iga cab ##rera , our charge d ' affair ##es in panama , that he must leave panama in 72 hours . 2 . we have expressed to the panama ##nian government , through the panama ##nian charge d ' affair ##es in lima , our surprise and strong protest over that decision . 3 . in view of this decision , the peruvian government has decided to reduce the personnel of its diplomatic mission in panama and to maintain its relations with that country at the first secretary level . peru will in this way continue to fulfill the humanitarian mission of protecting those who have sought asylum in its embassy in panama while the panama ##nian government issues the safe - conducts that we requested in accordance to the convention on diplomatic asylum signed in caracas on 28 march 1954 . peru is contact ##ing the members of the permanent mechanism for consultation and political agreement ( group of eight ) to explain the situation and to ask for solidarity and cooperation in overcoming this momentary crisis . the delicate situation regarding the people at the peruvian embassy has provoked our justified alarm and imp ##elled us to begin talks to ensure that their diplomatic asylum will be respected . we have talked with the ambassadors from the countries of the permanent mechanism for consultation and political agreement . i have personally spoken with the ambassadors of venezuela , mexico , and colombia . i am now ready to answer any questions : ( reporter ) mr la ##rco cox , unofficial sources have said that the people in the peruvian embassy in panama are not exactly political refugees but common criminals . what do you say about this ? ( la ##rco cox ) the country that grants asylum determines this . we have been very careful to review each one of them and their files . we have checked to see if any of them were facing any trials in panama or the united states . our investigation has revealed that none of them are facing any trials . the charges were made afterward . we see this as a result of the emotional climate presently existing in panama . ( reporter ) what is your personal opinion of the incident ? ( la ##rco cox ) it is the diplomatic way to express a protest over what they have been led to believe . according to panama ##nian reports , charge d ' affair ##es luis sand ##iga has made statements on the situation that did not please the government . the truth is that sand ##iga has not made any declaration ##s . however , former ambassador castro arenas is in panama and he has embarked on a campaign in which he is seeking retaliation against the peruvian government . he could not think of anything better than to point at sand ##iga as the person responsible for alleged statements . sand ##iga has not said a word about the situation because that is not his job . besides , his car and the car belonging to one of the embassy ' s military attache ##s have been stolen ; there is no way to begin an investigation . ( reporter ) are you saying that former ambassador castro arenas is directly responsible for the situation ? ( la ##rco cox ) you can make your own conclusions . ( reporter ) if the situation deter ##ior ##ates , will peru recall all of its personnel from panama ? ( la ##rco cox ) we cannot go to that extreme because we are fulfilling a humanitarian cause , as we said in the com ##mun ##ique . our first responsibility at this time is to see that the right of asylum is respected . as long as the refugees remain in the embassy , we will maintain our representation at the level of first secretary .
