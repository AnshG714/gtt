{"doctext": "salvador ##an president alfredo cr ##ist ##iani stated today that it would be no problem for the fourth penal judge , who is in charge of the case of the jesuits murdered by a group of soldiers , to order that cadets who are taking courses abroad return to the country . it was recently reported that several officers who testified during these investigations are now attending training courses abroad . it was also reported that the military school ' s registration book for persons entering or leaving the premises had been lost , including the pages that correspond to november 1989 . today , cr ##ist ##iani talked about this matter and said the judge should continue to investigate and not just make statements concerning the problems . ( begin recording ) ( cr ##ist ##iani ) i do not believe there is any problem in the officers returning to the country if a judge orders that they come to testify . all that is required is for the judge to summon them ; they would be brought to the country to testify and , after that , returned to their training courses . groups of soldiers are frequently sent abroad to take training courses to make them more professional ; this applies not only to personnel from the military school , but from all armed forces units . concerning the other matter , the judge has to investigate it . i believe that instead of just staying there , the judge should continue to search for evidence . tell me , what is the difference if they are brought back from such ##ito ##to or from the united states if they must testify before the judge ? there is no difference at all . ( end recording ) the president spoke today at the el salvador military airport before he left for costa rica to attend the inauguration ceremony of president - elect rafael calderon four ##nier . he also said that the united states conditioning 50 percent of the aid given to our country could cause the rebel front to increase their actions . he accused the fm ##ln ( far ##ab ##und ##o mart ##i national liberation front ) of using dialogue for tactical reasons . ( begin recording ) ( cr ##ist ##iani ) we have stated that an action of this type would be very un ##time ##ly , as it could make the most radical fm ##ln members decide to continue the war and , thus , hind ##er the dialogue process . ( reporter ) however , ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) pressure government for them ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) with fm ##ln . ( cr ##ist ##iani ) i would ask the question : who has always showed goodwill and sincerely sought an agreement and who has not done this ? history shows that in the past , the fm ##ln has used the proposals by ( jose napoleon ) du ##arte ' s government and my own for tactical reasons . it has not been the governments . i believe that the fm ##ln must understand and be pressured to really search for a political solution . ( end recording ) also today , the un secretary general authorized a spokesman to announce that talks between the government and fm ##ln will be renewed on 16 may . the panorama that surrounds this new encounter , however , presents an entirely different pattern from meetings in the past , because both sectors have met with political parties represented at the ( word ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) . furthermore , although the government has not done the same with the country ' s social forces , the rebels will try to do so this week . undoubtedly , the results that could be obtained from the dialogue could be much more important than those obtained during past negotiations , because almost all the sectors that have become involved , directly or indirectly , in the negotiating demand that the agreements attained be based on internal cooperation .", "pred_seq": "[CLS]", "pred_templates": [], "gold_templates": [{"incident_type": "attack", "PerpInd": [["group of soldiers", "soldiers"]], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [], "Victim": [], "Weapon": []}], "docid": "30098"}
