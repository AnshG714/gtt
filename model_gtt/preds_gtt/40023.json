  "doctext": "the plan included several points . the purpose of this plan was to pressure general nor ##ieg ##a to resign from his military post in late august . the psychological objectives of this plan were : to int ##ens ##ify and spread the rep ##udi ##ation of nor ##ieg ##a within the f ##dp ; to int ##ens ##ify and spread the rep ##udi ##ation of nor ##ieg ##a ' s collaborators by mentioning specific names ; to convince nor ##ieg ##a that he had lost f ##dp support and that his regime was un ##sus ##tain ##able ; to convince nor ##ieg ##a ' s panama ##nian collaborators that he had lost f ##dp support and that his regime was un ##sus ##tain ##able ; to convince foreign governments and nor ##ieg ##a allies , particularly cuba and nicaragua , that he had lost f ##dp support and that his government was un ##sus ##tain ##able ; to convince governments that were hostile to nor ##ieg ##a , especially venezuela and colombia , that he had lost f ##dp support and that his regime was un ##sus ##tain ##able ; to convince foreign revolutionary movements that dealt with nor ##ieg ##a , such as the fm ##ln and the m - 19 , that he had lost f ##dp support and that his regime was un ##sus ##tain ##able ; and to move the anti - nor ##ieg ##a sector within the f ##dp to support specific actions against nor ##ieg ##a ' s regime . the f ##dp members , officers , and troops were the targets of this plan . we see how some were taken in by the psychological operations plan . the targets of this plan were gen nor ##ieg ##a , nor ##ieg ##a ' s panama ##nian collaborators within the f ##dp , some civilians , foreign governments that are nor ##ieg ##a ' s allies , foreign governments that are hostile to nor ##ieg ##a , and foreign revolutionary organizations that deal with nor ##ieg ##a . they identified all of nor ##ieg ##a ' s vu ##ln ##era ##bilities , as well as the vu ##ln ##era ##bilities of all the targets we have already mentioned . there were certain themes used in these psychological operations , and the media fell for them many times . this is why we repeatedly asked them not to fall for this mis ##in ##form ##ation . these themes included : by imposing his arbitrary nature and corruption , nor ##ieg ##a is per ##vert ##ing the f ##dp and promoting the di ##sin ##te ##gration of that military institution . the f ##dp have become a mafia that is heading toward disgrace . this is a topic that has been discussed in leaflets and many publications . by disrupt ##ing the constitutional order at his w ##him , nor ##ieg ##a is pro ##voking a profound social , economic , and political crisis that is ruining the country . this is done to hide those who are truly responsible for the crisis we are experiencing . the longer nor ##ieg ##a remains in power , the more probable becomes a u . s . , cuban , or soviet intervention . the domestic and international conflicts provoked by nor ##ieg ##a negatively affect the personal well - being of the f ##dp members and their families . nor ##ieg ##a ' s fall is inevitable and the f ##dp should not fall with him . to save the f ##dp and the republic of panama , the f ##dp must remove nor ##ieg ##a from office . this is why there were siren songs that an internal coup was under way . the state security organizations have been following this case for 5 months and we know the fugitive ##s are in the united states . we know where they left from . no one can deny the association of certain u . s . citizens who are involved in this operation with the panama ##nian groups that were captured . we have the evidence , the weapons , the instruments used for mis ##in ##form ##ation , the plans , and the maps with the targets for violence . important people who were going to be kidnapped had also been marked on these maps . they had marked the bridges that were to be destroyed . gentlemen , we know the power of weapons and we know how to use them . we know the damage they can do . therefore , before there was a violent confrontation between the panama ##nian people and their f ##dp , we went one step ahead of their plans . if arrests were made , it was because we wanted to avoid a confrontation with inexperienced groups that allowed themselves to be used for the personal benefit of those who received , with a siren song , the promise of the panama ##nian people ' s $ 30 million that eric arturo del ##val ##le was going to use for sub ##vers ##ive acts , bloody acts to bath ##e our people in blood , as in the case of the struggle of our brother countries in latin and central america . we will not permit that . that is why we decided to go one step ahead and foil these plans that have a certain purpose and that would result in mourning and pain for panama ##nian families . we have the evidence and those who were arrested were damn well arrested : alberto con ##te , fred boyd , and all those people who have been working behind the scenes so eduardo herrera and friends can live like kings in the united state ##ts , so they can live their lives drinking champagne and eating ph ##ea ##sant . eduardo herrera was dismissed from a diplomatic post for smuggling 40 boxes of whiskey per week into israel . he is the kind of person protected by the pentagon and elliott abrams . he is elliott abrams ' hero . theresa wellington of the ( u . s . ) embassy in mexico , who gave these people - - who left panama for mexico - - their visas in 10 minutes by abrams ' orders , has also become one of our people ' s enemies .
