{"doctext": ". . . that the fm ##ln ( far ##ab ##und ##o mart ##i national liberation front ) launched against the salvador ##an people on 11 november . the fm ##ln launched this aggression with all of its forces , chiefly using a concentration of weapons and fighters in the san salvador metropolitan zone , in zac ##ate ##col ##uca , la paz department , and at times in us ##ulu ##tan city , us ##ulu ##tan de ##par ##ment , and in san miguel city , san miguel department . in this aggression the fm ##ln displayed its weaponry . it displayed an incredible amount of weapons , which . . . . ( changes thought ) by the way , in recent days the salvador ##an armed forces have begun a number of searches in some houses where it is believed that some of these weapons were located . we have already found large amounts of weapons . in addition , the fm ##ln launched an aggression and hid behind you , salvador ##an people . it used you as a shield , wanting to convey the idea that they have the support of the salvador ##an people and that the people here would rise up to support them . they have realized that this view is totally false . far from supporting the fm ##ln , the salvador ##an people , salvador ##an brothers , supported the armed forces in the tremendous effort it has conducted to rep ##el the fm ##ln aggression . however , we must now consider a very important matter . it is impossible to carry out an aggression of this size without support from someone abroad . on this occasion , we are certain that this support came from nicaragua ##n president ortega and cuban president castro , but chiefly from ortega who is trying to raise a smoke ##screen in the face of the real possibility that mrs violet ##ta cha ##mo ##rro may defeat him in the elections , and because the fm ##ln has always been the puppet of the international communist aggression in which ortega and castro participate . if this is not so , let us take a look at what has happened . during those times when you were suffering moments of anguish last week , you were able to see the large number of foreigners who were supporting the fm ##ln terrorists . we have also managed to collect evidence that the ortega government trained fm ##ln fighters in the use of certain kinds of weaponry , specifically the grenade launcher ##s . what happened ? in the past few weeks we began noticing what kind of weapons were being used . in the foil ##ed attack on the presidential house , a subsequent attack on the salvador ##an armed forces ' joint chiefs of staff , and lastly , an attack on the national guard garrison particular kinds of weapons were being used . as a result of the savage action by fm ##ln , two little girls were killed . moreover , let us recall and see the connection that exists with all the shipments that the salvador ##an armed forces have been stopping between nicaragua ##n and el salvador . one shipment was made prior to the visit we presidents made to costa rica . in that country , we denounced ortega for continuing to send weapons and supporting the fm ##ln in an open violation of the central american peace process . and what has happened lately ? on 25 november , salvador ##an people , two light airplanes coming from nicaragua were discovered . their flight course indicates that they came from nicaragua , especially the one where the weapons were found . as additional proof , we have a document showing that one light aircraft belongs to the set ##a transportation company located in nicaragua ' s augusto cesar sand ##ino airport . it was bringing sophisticated equipment for the fm ##ln . in that aircraft accident , four people were killed : the pilot who was wearing civilian clothes and three other people were wearing military uniforms ; i mean camouflage uniforms like the ones worn in many countries , and like the ones the salvador ##an armed force use . it is believed that two of those people died as a result of the accident . we also believe that another person killed himself because he had a weapon in his hand and a bullet wound in forehead . he killed himself because he saw himself implicated in this situation .
