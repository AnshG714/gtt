  "doctext": ". . . over the red telephone and second , all hostilities have un ##ila ##tera ##lly ended on all far ##c fronts . the government once asked me why they do not begin a un ##ila ##tera ##l end of hostilities if they have goodwill . here it is . i cannot do any more ; i hope the government does not let this opportunity pass . ( gr ##ac ##ia ) do you believe talks should continue with the guerrilla groups ? ( ley ##va ) the truth is that i proposed something to the government , the political parties , and the guerrillas . what you call talks is nothing more than the guerrillas ' reply to the proposal - - the same way as ( former president ) dr tu ##rba ##y , social conservative party president dr fabio valencia , and dr jar ##ami ##llo os ##sa of the patriotic union did . the cardinals have been informed of the proposal , and the m - 19 and far ##c have replied . in fact , they went even further ; they un ##ila ##tera ##lly ended hostilities . now the ball is in the government ' s court . ( gr ##ac ##ia ) taking into account that after agreeing not to , for example , carry out any ambush ##es against troops , the guerrillas continued ; they broke the agreement . do you think we can again trust these statements ? ( ley ##va ) i cannot measure the confidence that should be given to others . the only thing i know is the government is seeking peace , so i imagine this is precisely the way . the suspicion that the government might have of them is the same as you might have , but if the government seeks peace , here is where they can find it , with a preliminary end to hostilities on all fronts . this is what ( far ##c general secretary ) jacob ##o arenas wrote in a letter that was not addressed to me but to the former presidents of colombia .
