  "doctext": "marco antonio gu ##eva ##ra , of the \" up to date \" newscast . ( gu ##eva ##ra ) how do the five presidents con ##ce ##ive the demo ##bil ##ization of the fm ##ln ? how does the salvador ##an government con ##ce ##ive this happening ? ( cr ##ist ##iani ) i believe there have been substantial changes in this presidential meeting as compared to previous meetings . to explain this better , marco antonio , we must say we will not fall into what has been used in the past , that is , the famous symmetry . on this occasion , we have been very clear and cat ##egorical when we said that we were not willing to continue contributing sacrifices and other things from the salvador ##an government in order to solve the nicaragua ##n problem exclusively . we demanded uniform ##ity , and any other country confronting the aggression of an irregular force - - any other country in central america - - also has the right to be treated in a uniform manner , as far as measures and criteria that may be adopted in the presidential meetings . that is why today for the first time you are seeing how the measures adopted for the nicaragua ##n resistance - - that had been granted most of the attention up to now - - are also being adopted for the fm ##ln . we cannot allow a country to claim it is the only target of an aggression by an irregular armed force supported from abroad . here in el salvador we now have greater evidence following this 11 november terrorist aggression that the fm ##ln is a movement that can survive only with support from abroad , and that it obey ##s and exists because of international movements . in the second place , it has demonstrated that it only has the capacity to generate terrorism , which has been mentioned in this document . we cannot continue just talking about demo ##bil ##ization and pacific ##ation in nicaragua . it is time to apply this to all irregular groups , be it the ur ##ng ( guatemala ##n national revolutionary unity ) in guatemala , or any other irregular armed group that may come up and may try to hind ##er the democratic process in the area . we see this as something that has gone deep into the minds of all the central american presidents , and from now on , we will have greater uniform ##ity in treating all of those irregular groups that operate in the region . ( moderator ) rene hurt ##ado of el mundo . ( hurt ##ado ) mr president , following the tel ##a and costa del sol meetings , nicaragua has changed its stand . in costa rica , president ortega was asked if he had sold out the fm ##ln in exchange for the demo ##bil ##ization of the contra ##s and other results of the summit in favor of nicaragua . i would like to know your opinion about this , and also how you interpret the fact that president ortega has accepted some issues about the fm ##ln that he did not allow in tel ##a or costa del sol ? on the other hand , will the demo ##bil ##ization of the fm ##ln be the result of a dialogue or negotiations later on ? ( cr ##ist ##iani ) in the first place , i believe that daniel ortega was unable to pull any more tricks out of his hat , and he was facing a fact he could no longer hide : he is the one who is spreading armed revolutions in central america and trying to ham ##per democratic processes in the region . once more he has been caught not honoring the commitments agreed on in tel ##a , but rather violating these commitments . on this occasion he has been left with no possible defense . therefore , in our opinion , he has no option other than to accept the reality of what is happening in central america , or see himself totally isolated amid a peace plan that has international support . this situation would cause him many problems and headache ##s in political and diplomatic matters .",
