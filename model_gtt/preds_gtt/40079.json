  "doctext": "there is a subject of interest to radio havana listeners : the ur ##ng ' s human ##ization of the war policy . ( villa ##gra ##n ) right now , the political and diplomatic commission , on directions from the ur ##ng general command , is making every effort to human ##ize the war situation in the country , especially by showing respect for the geneva agreement , which guatemala signed . we are doing this because the rep ##ress ##ive war the army has been wa ##ging against the revolutionary movement and the population has reached levels of extreme cruelty , including ind ##is ##cr ##imi ##nate bombings and the use of def ##oli ##ants in conflict zones where civilians live . there is the particular situation in which neither the guatemala ##n army nor the government take any war prisoners . this makes us believe that the cruelty used against civilians and people involved in the armed conflict is a violation of human rights . ( martinez ) does the ur ##ng have any prisoners at this moment ? ( villa ##gra ##n ) yes . we have sent a note to the national reconciliation commission so it can handle the case of soldier carlos perez lopez , who was captured wounded in the san marcos region , near gal ##vez . he has been given much medical attention . now that he has fully recovered , we are thinking about publicly returning this guatemala ##n , and we are asking the reconciliation commission to take measures through the international red cross ( ir ##c ) to receive this man in the framework of the human ##ization process . ( martinez ) will this be the first time the ur ##ng will make this kind of contact with the ir ##c ? ( villa ##gra ##n ) the ir ##c has had local ##ization problems . there has been the argument that there is a national red cross . contact with the ir ##c is possible if there is a presence of this organization that functions based on international agreements . now that the ir ##c is present , the work is being facilitated . the contact with the ir ##c is at the initiation level . however , i believe these contacts will be very useful in the future , especially for persons not involved in the armed conflict . ( martinez ) i think it would be useful if we close this interview with you repeating the name of the guatemala ##n army soldier who is being held by the ur ##ng and whom the guerrilla forces are prepared to turn over to the ir ##c . ( villa ##gra ##n ) yes . his name is carlos lopez perez ( as heard ) . ( martinez ) thank you , villa ##gra ##n .",
