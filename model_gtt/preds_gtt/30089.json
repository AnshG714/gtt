{"doctext": "the salvador ##an government maintains its stance regarding the dialogue process and its res ##ump ##tion . we believe it constitutes the most ex ##ped ##ient way to achieve peace in the country , and we are going to continue along that path .

( mont ##al ##vo ) in regard to the rene ##go ##tia ##tion of the foreign debt , when are you planning to go to mexico , and how will the salvador ##an debt with that country be rene ##go ##tia ##ted ? ( cr ##ist ##iani ) the timetable for the trip is still und ##ec ##ided . there is not definite date . i think it may take place in april or may of this year . our first scheduled visit will be to venezuela . ( moderator ) carlos mario marquez of age ##nce france press ##e . ( marquez ) ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) social aspects . i would like to know what the status is of that , since some support having primary meetings and then a summit , so to speak ? ( cr ##ist ##iani ) i do not think that is the cause of that problem . we said that the res ##ump ##tion of the talks must take place when the fm ##ln enters the dialogue process with a serious attitude . we maintain our stance that they must stop all violence that is directly and indirectly affecting civilians , that is , all the terrorist activities the fm ##ln conducts . this is a small request that obtained the support of all the central american presidents at the san is ##id ##ro corona ##do meeting in costa rica . i think that this is the cause of the problem . they have asked for changes in format , and we said we had no problem with most of the requests we have received . we are now waiting for the fm ##ln , since they asked for time to analyze things a little before having the meeting . we are awaiting the visit of mr . de soto in early march . obviously , the dialogue has not taken place because there are some differences , ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) . i think the chief difference is that the fm ##ln does not want to agree to stop terrorist actions , and that is why there is no dialogue now . ( moderator ) ep ##ig ##men ##io ib ##ar ##ra . ( ib ##ar ##ra ) mr . president , yesterday in nicaragua , daniel ortega said at a rally that he will wage a constructive opposition . he said that the revolution did not die with the elections . he said that the sand ##ini ##st national liberation front ( f ##sl ##n ) will rule from below . we sense a pretty complex climate for the transition in nicaragua . what do you think about daniel ortega ' s statements ? how do you view the possibility that there may be a true transition from power to power instead of a transition of government in nicaragua ? ( cr ##ist ##iani ) as i have said before , statements by ortega and other representatives of the sand ##ini ##st front are a source of concern . they could indicate that the elections may have been very free and honest , but also a far ##ce as far as improving the democratic process is concerned . the nicaragua ##n people would be denied the right to freely pick their rulers and the right of these rulers to act as they dee ##m best . i would say that the nicaragua ##n revolution belongs not just to the f ##sl ##n . the f ##sl ##n was one of the participants in the revolution in nicaragua against ana ##sta ##sio so ##mo ##za . the fact is that a consensus existed among all sectors that supported that revolution . the f ##sl ##n has no monopoly on or exclusive control over that revolution . i believe that in ideological terms there are differences between the views of ms . cha ##mo ##rro and uno ( national opposition union ) , that is , the new government - elect , and the views of the f ##sl ##n . yet , the people picked the government . it is wo ##rri ##some to hear some statements that the f ##sl ##n will rule from below . we believe they would seek to do that by keeping control over the army . let me repeat : there is nothing democratic about a political party controlling the army . the army must respond to the government and the country ' s democratic process , and not to just one political party . we believe things have not been settled yet . we believe that there are still many things left pending .
