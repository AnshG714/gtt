{"doctext": "the most pressing demands of the chilean people have been brought up in the electoral campaign . one of the most important achievements of this campaign has been the combining of the campaign with the just economic , political , and social demands that the democratic forces and the popular movement have been making for these 16 years of dictatorship . these demands are related to the struggle against repression , the defense of human rights , the den ##unciation of crimes committed by the regime , and efforts to fight immunity and the suppression of the truth regarding torture , disappearance ##s , and assassination ##s . these questions have once again come into the spotlight now that many right ##ist candidates are dem ##ago ##gical ##ly attempting to pose as defenders of human rights and since el mer ##cu ##rio has reported that the dictator is planning to convert the cn ##i ( national information center ) into an agency of the army so that the main rep ##ress ##ive body from all these years can be under his direct control . jaime in ##zu ##nza , leader of the united left and the communist party of chile , discusses these topics over a direct phone line from santiago , chile . ( begin recording ) ( announcer ) how are the chilean people ' s demands connected to the ongoing electoral campaign ? ( in ##zu ##nza ) they are connected through the democrat ##ization of the neighborhood boards during the electoral process ; the strengthening of the unified actions of workers ; the development of the committees for victory , which will also be committees for the defense of victory and committees for carrying on the democratic task ; the development of confidence ; the struggle for human rights , particularly concerning truth and justice and immunity for crimes ; the increasing pressure by the immense majority of the population for the release of all political prisoners ; and naturally for the dissolution of the cn ##i . all of these questions are being brought up in the electoral campaign , and agreements have been reached within social organizations . this was evidenced a week ago by the salvador ##a strike and by the current strike by coal miners . this proves that the people have understood that the electoral campaign has to be an expression of their activities and a way to strengthen their social organizations for the future struggle . ( end recording ) the preceding comments were made by communist party of chile leader jaime in ##zu ##nza , who has been interviewed over the telephone on our program \" es ##cu ##cha chile . \" another topic discussed by in ##zu ##nza was the el mer ##cu ##rio report on the cn ##i ' s transfer to the army . the dissolution of the cn ##i has become one of the most pressing demands of the immense majority of chilean ##s . ( begin recording ) ( announcer ) what is your opinion , jaime in ##zu ##nza , on the dictator ' s intention to maintain the cn ##i as it is and to keep it under his direct command ? ( in ##zu ##nza ) i believe that this issue is particularly serious . the intention is to maintain intact the main terrorist apparatus of the dictatorship , which has been responsible for the most flag ##rant violations of human rights throughout the years of its existence . i understand that the dina ( national intelligence directorate , replaced by cn ##i ) and the cn ##i have been in fact a single apparatus and therefore the main organs of state terror ##ris ##m over the past 15 years . if transferred to the army , the cn ##i would continue to be under pin ##oche ##t ' s orders . under whose orders has it been all these years ? for whom has it been a direct agent all these years ? hence ##forth it will be under the control of the office of the commander in chief of the army . ( end recording ) communist leader jaime in ##zu ##nza added that pin ##oche ##t ' s intent in transferring the cn ##i to the army ' s direct command is to make the institution an acc ##omp ##lice in conceal ##ing people who have been responsible for crimes and human rights violations . ( begin recording ) ( in ##zu ##nza ) the idea is to involve the military institution in crimes for which the chilean people knows it was not responsible . this is clear : what the democratic opposition forces want is to have the cu ##lp ##rit ##s behind those crimes and human rights violations prosecuted , not the military institution . the transfer of the cn ##i to the army is an attempt to make the men in uniform act as acc ##omp ##lices or accessories to those crimes . loyalty is not at stake here ; loyalty is defending values and principles , not some sort of criminal com ##plicity that is not in line with the training of these men . this seems to me to be particularly serious because this transfer implies maintaining the cn ##i under the orders of the man responsible for the crimes committed all these years , the dictator himself . ( end recording ) these have been answers given by jaime in ##zu ##nza , united left and communist party of chile leader , to questions put to him over the phone by \" es ##cu ##cha chile , \" a radio moscow international program .", "pred_seq": "[CLS]", "pred_templates": [], "gold_templates": [], "docid": "30047"}
