{"doctext": "we are not demanding that they stop their operations as a pre ##con ##dition for negotiating . however , it should be clear that we are facing the same situation as before , therefore , we have the same rights and will continue our operations until a cease - fire is agreed . in caracas we committed ourselves to negotiating and holding talks in order to obtain a cease - fire and the necessary agreements for the benefit of the country and the entire nation . that is the important issue right now . we have been fighting without that goal , without having any commitment to negotiate anything . however , that does not mean that the situation should remain the same . now there is a new factor , a commitment to negotiate and reach agreements on all those topics . it is very important that the salvador ##an people know the contents of the agenda , that they are fully aware of all the topics to be discussed , and that they know the importance of the timetable agreement for discussions and negotiations . you journalists can help the people understand problem . ( reporter ) ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) commander , when do you expect the fm ##ln to join the process ? ( hand ##al ) look , deadline ##s are not the most important thing right now . what is important now is comply ##ing with the agreements to reach political agreements . that is the main aspect of the geneva agreement . it is possible that some deadline ##s will not be met . if deadline ##s are set and the time for implementing them ex ##pire ##s , then this is tan ##tam ##ount to wasting time . this then leads to steps being demanded that in reality depend on the political agreements that are reached and not the deadline ##s for reaching them . therefore , according to the agenda and the timetable agreed to here in caracas , the accent is on the political agreements . those agreements have to do with changes within the armed forces . everything related to the armed forces must be changed . every factor concerning the armed forces must be reviewed from a certain point or perspective . changes are necessary ; changes must be made and those changes must be significant . these changes must completely transform the armed forces , beginning with its role and influence in determining the country ' s policies and guidelines . we have been presenting proposals in this regard for some time . the topic of democrat ##ization is closely linked to the topic of the armed forces , to its pu ##rg ##ing , its reduction , and in sum , its end . we believe that the country will not always need the armed forces . as with any institution or historical factor , it emerges , it is maintained for a certain time , and then it tends to disappear . the country must have the opportunity to develop . it cannot continue along the same path because this would only represent expenses and a heavy burden for the country . for several decades , the armed forces have meant absence of liberty , real security , and the imp ##oss ##ibility of the civilian society to decide the country ' s path . elections have been turned into a mere formal ##ity , where those who were not elected run the country . the country is now going through a drama that has also shocked the international public , the murder of the jesuit priests . everyone is awaiting the results of the investigations and hoping that those who were responsible for this crime will be punished . we believe that the case of jesuit priests is really grave ; it is a drama that reflects the drama of the salvador ##an people ' s history in the current century .
