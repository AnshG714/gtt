  "doctext": "an explosion has destroyed a section of the multi ##pur ##pose pipeline running from barr ##an ##ca ##ber ##me ##ja to bu ##car ##aman ##ga . the explosion occurred in alto de san pablo while gasoline and prop ##ane gas were being pumped to bu ##car ##aman ##ga . we have a report now from teresa rue ##da . ( begin recording ) ( rue ##da ) communications to and from puerto petrol ##ero and bu ##car ##aman ##ga have been cut off since early today , after an attempt to dynamite the multi ##pur ##pose pipeline destroyed a 100 - meter section of the central highway . the supply of gas to bu ##car ##aman ##ga will also be affected by this event . it is estimated that it will take at least 3 days to restore normal traffic , because it will be necessary to use dynamite to remove rocks currently blocking the highway . the attempted sabotage occurred at the 65 - km mark on the bu ##car ##aman ##ga - barr ##an ##ca ##ber ##me ##ja highway , 20 km from the place where a military convoy was ambushed last wednesday . this is the second time that an attempted sabotage of the bu ##car ##aman ##ga - barr ##an ##ca ##ber ##me ##ja multi ##pur ##pose pipeline , which carries prop ##ane gas , gasoline , and ac ##pm ( not further identified ) has taken place . the explosion destroyed a 30 - meter section of pipeline , and sparked a fire that has not yet been extinguished . losses caused by the sabotage , which has been attributed to the el ##n , have yet to be as ##cer ##tained . it is estimated that repairs to the highway alone will cost the public works ministry 5 million pe ##sos . ( is ##ma ##el oro ##z ##co , public works director for the 5th district ) well , after initial talks with eco ##pet ##rol ( colombian petroleum enterprise ) technicians today , beginning at 1700 , after the fire is under control , they will begin restoring service on the oil pipeline . ( rue ##da ) at this time , there is traffic congestion near the su ##gam ##oso bridge . ( end recording ) ( passage omitted ) while still on the subject , eco ##pet ##rol ' s president , who traveled this morning to barr ##an ##ca ##ber ##me ##ja to attend a forum on the magdalena river , reported that , so far this year , terrorist attacks have cost his company $ 300 million . we have this report from maria clara gr ##ac ##ia . ( begin recording ) ( gr ##ac ##ia ) eco ##pet ##rol has lost 95 billion pe ##sos in revenues this year due to the 44 terrorist attacks on the can ##o limo ##n - coven ##as oil pipeline . in these attacks , 13 . 2 million barrels of crude oil have been lost . the areas most affected by these attacks are in su ##cre , ara ##uca , norte de santa ##nder , and santa ##nder departments . ( reporter alvaro a ##yala ) doctor , could these terrorist attacks lead to an increase in fuel prices in colombia ? ( dr andres rest ##re ##po london ##o , president of eco ##pet ##rol ) obviously , there will come a time when , faced with increasing internal production costs and falling revenues , we are going to have to consider com ##pen ##sat ##ing our losses with an increase in domestic oil prices , but that is a measure we are not about to adopt at this time . ( gr ##ac ##ia ) today ' s landslide , which destroyed a section of the multi ##pur ##pose pipeline between barr ##an ##ca ##ber ##me ##ja and bu ##car ##aman ##ga , has resulted in estimated losses total ##ling 1 . 435 billion pe ##sos .
