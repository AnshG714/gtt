  "doctext": "comrades : a new element that we must analyze and explain emerged at the conclusion of the central american presidents ' emergency meeting . let us see first why the meeting took place . the main reason is the very complicated pre ##dic ##ament in which our offensive has placed cr ##ist ##iani and the high command . as you will remember , the government has met with much international di ##sr ##ep ##ute and isolation because of the brutal assassination of jesuit priests and the bombing of the civilian population . let us recall , as a significant fact , that the united nations has condemned the government because of all it has done , especially because of the latest atrocities . on that occasion , el salvador was the only country that voted against that resolution while 96 countries voted in favor . we mention this case as a most significant one , but the fact is that there has been so much worldwide condemnation that the dictatorship has found itself in a really desperate situation . this was a cause of concern for the north americans . to whom could they turn at a time when all international organizations had turned their backs on cr ##ist ##iani ? the north americans had to resort to some forum that would not condemn the gen ##oc ##idal regime and that , on the contrary , would provide support in spite of all the atrocities the regime has committed . the most suitable idea was to promote an emergency meeting of central american presidents , because in central america , as we all know , the north americans have had their backyard and most of these countries serve their interests . the meeting was called to try to pull cr ##ist ##iani out of international isolation . under what conditions did summit take place ? we have to say first that the presidents of el salvador and costa rica , and probably of guatemala , had reached an agreement prior to the meeting . the subject of the discussion was a document drafted by arias and ce ##re ##zo . this document expressed support for cr ##ist ##iani from the very beginning . joseph sullivan , a u . s . state department official in charge of latin american affairs , as well as other u . s . state department officials , were present at the meeting . the costa rican ambassador to nicaragua - - a pro - u . s . man who introduced the nicaragua ##n contra ##s at the meeting - - was also present , con ##sp ##iring all the time . the fm ##ln was not even allowed to enter costa rica . however , in spite of the fact that the meeting had been fixed and in spite of the u . s . presence , the agreement to support cr ##ist ##iani was achieved almost at the price of killing the esq ##ui ##pu ##las agreement . it was not easy . the u . s . will to condemn the fm ##ln and to back cr ##ist ##iani prevailed in the midst of much bi ##cker ##ing and the ins ##ole ##nce of the hon ##dur ##an president . as you can see , it was not easy to find support for the gen ##oc ##idal regime even in places where the north americans think they have the bull by the horns . let us see , as a third point , in what the declaration consists .
