these are a true ##r and more accurate reflection of a firm ' s income . \" cr ##ist ##iani says that the country ' s monetary policy must be aimed at increasing savings to promote domestic economic development . he says that it is necessary to make interest received on savings accounts in the country ' s banks more attractive so that capital does not leave the country . regarding the country ' s currency , cr ##ist ##iani says : \" we feel that currency value should be based on the availability of and demand for foreign exchange . we do not think it is appropriate for the government to ar ##bit ##rar ##ily dev ##al ##ue and fix an exchange rate on the salvador ##an colon . everything must be based on the foreign exchange our country may have to pay out for imports , because if we were to fix the rate at 10 ( colon ##es ) to 1 ( dollar ) , the central banks still would not have enough foreign exchange to cover all the import ##ers ' demands . \" further details as available .",
