{"doctext": "do you have any comments on the amnesty international report , which claims that the armed forces are involved in the murder of certain salvador ##an citizens ? ( du ##arte ) i understand that amnesty international has to prepare a report every year , and the organization includes whatever views it chooses in the report . the organization obviously states its views in the report . salvador ##ans do things according to the law . if any salvador ##an or foreigner has evidence ( of human rights violations ) , then it should be brought before the courts . that is the logical and legal way for us to begin an investigation ; that is what we always do in all such cases . ( reporter ) mr president , your government has issued a special report claiming that some death squad members have deserted and implicated several right - wing members in the murder of ms ##gr oscar ar ##nu ##lf ##o romero and other salvador ##ans . ( du ##arte ) we are analyzing the available evidence in those cases . you know that i have carefully analyzed the cases . i released information only when the evidence was duly investigated and co ##rro ##bor ##ated . we are processing a sizable amount of information , but i do not want to discuss it in detail because i believe that this would hind ##er the investigation . ( reporter ) is it true that you have two video recordings in which the two desert ##ers give their names and details and that these recordings are being analyzed by military intelligence services and the government ? ( du ##arte ) we are currently investigating the case . that is why i said that i would not like to reveal any detailed information - - because this might hind ##er the investigation . ( reporter ) mr president , the amnesty international report states that death squads - - which are reportedly composed of soldiers and policemen - - are being reactivated at a time when the armed forces oppose your policies . ( du ##arte ) i do not think so . my government ' s policy remains unchanged . we advocate the defense of human rights and democracy . i think this is always evident . every day this is demonstrated by events . ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) film about guerrilla commanders , which represents support for the fm ##ln and di ##stor ##ts the people ' s views . nevertheless , we know that freedom of the press must pre ##va ##il and therefore we do not intervene . you will not find another country that does this , yet we are doing so because we believe that we should defend freedom of the press above all . ( reporter ) how much cr ##ede ##nce do you give the amnesty international report ? ( du ##arte ) the report is valid ins ##of ##ar as the facts are all there . however , i ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) the way in which the facts are interpreted . the facts are interpreted according to amnesty international ' s own ( word ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) . we also received reports from red cross international ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) each case . each case is interpreted differently . the united nations has its own opinion ; the o ##as has its own opinion . each one issues a report , and we use that information as the basis for our investigations on human rights violations , which is the main issue .
