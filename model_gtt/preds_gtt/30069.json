  "doctext": "the picture published today by the newspaper gran ##ma in its third edition speaks for itself . in fact , as the newspaper suggests , the yankee hand is today in el salvador as it was yesterday in vietnam . the wounded mother who tries to comfort her daughter , a victim of the bombings , is not an isolated picture . it is a symbol of the crimes that are being committed against the civilian population in that country . the united states is not innocent of these crimes because u . s . pilots are participating in the massacre . in the meantime , what is the human rights champion doing ? in fact , he is doing nothing that could not be predicted . president bush gets on the phone and calls his salvador ##an cr ##ony alfredo cr ##ist ##ini to assure him that everything is all right , that he can go on , that the u . s . position is favorable to his regime . the human rights champion asks no questions about the recent brutal killings of union leaders by the army . bush asks no questions about the massacre of spanish priests . the president only praises the army , the air force , the police and paramilitary efforts to stop the guerrilla offensive . bush and cr ##ist ##iani could not fail to mention the tri ##te slogan of the cuban and nicaragua ##n aid to the salvador ##an guerrillas . nor did bush fail to express the american people ' s solidarity . but , solidarity with whom ? all we have heard about up to now are the protests provoked in the united states by the u . s . military aid to the salvador ##an regime . the only realities are the demonstrations staged from los angeles to new york to rep ##udi ##ate the u . s . aid . the only fact is that the human rights champion is being publicly questioned about this aid . the only picture that has been di ##sse ##minated throughout the world is that of a woman who interrupt ##s bush ' s speech to shout to him : why are we sending money to el salvador ? why are we killing priests in el salvador ? it is not possible to overlook the u . s . government ' s responsibility in the current salvador ##an situation . the international community must be aware of this reality and must act accordingly .",
