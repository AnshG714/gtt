  "doctext": "dear listeners , the minister has arrived and we welcome him and thank him for his participation in this segment . good morning . ( vi ##des ) good morning . ( reporter ) violence has increased recently and the people are extremely worried . what are the armed forces doing to guarantee the people ' s welfare ? ( vi ##des ) the salvador ##an people ' s concern about increased terrorist violence is understand ##able . we must bear in mind that terrorist acts always es ##cala ##te when important events are expected . this does not happen only in our country ; we recently saw it in seoul , before the olympics , when groups resort ##ed to violence to provoke the authorities and prevent an international event from taking place . an o ##as meeting is scheduled to take place in this country in a few days . the event is being threatened by a number of acts , particularly terrorist acts in the san benito , max diaz , es ##cal ##on , and san francisco neighborhoods . the terrorists believe the people will protest against the o ##as meeting if they cause terror in those areas . we are expecting foreign ministers from latin america , central america , and the united states , whom the terrorists believe will call off the meeting because of the situation in the country . that is the main reason for the increased violence . you have seen that we have increased patrol operations recently . patrols are also being carried out around the volcanoes near san salvador . security measures are also being implemented on the periphery of san salvador and around the meeting venue , but i cannot give you the details . there is also a complete security plan for the officials who will participate in the o ##as meeting . we are ready to reduce the possibility of an incident to a minimum . however , i have always been honest and i must admit there is always the possibility of sabotage or a terrorist act . this does not necessarily mean that it will affect the security measures in the area of the meeting . for example , a blackout can be caused by cutting off an electric line in a distant area . ( reporter ) general , the fm ##ln ' s attacks have not been so overwhelming in the past , yet now those attacks are attaining considerable military success . do the fm ##ln ' s military actions mean it is superior to the armed forces ? ( vi ##des ) we cannot con ##ce ##ive their military superiority under any circumstances . i have noticed the guerrilla leaders are currently visiting different countries , particularly the con ##tad ##ora group members . they are trying to gain support for reading a statement at the o ##as meeting , and they are also trying to pressure the salvador ##an government into negotiating with them . this proves the rebels have failed mil ##ita ##rily , and that failure has been brought about by our large - scale operations in northern cha ##late ##nan ##go department and us ##ulu ##tan department , in the east of the country . the rebels have tried to bring the war to urban areas . however , the plans of sub ##vers ##ive groups - - i showed you the documents on their fire plan in another meeting - - did not include the type of terrorist acts that we have seen lately . instead , they planned a general uprising and strike before the elections . this proves , as i said , that the sub ##vers ##ives could not develop their fire plan . they have carried out several acts but they have failed to achieve the expected results . this is like having a cinema show a movie every day with no - one turning up to see it . the sub ##vers ##ives are trying to carry out this type of event right now to give the impression of military strength , so the o ##as will pass a resolution recommend ##ing negotiation to solve the conflict . furthermore , the rebels are trying to disc ##red ##it the democratic process and boycott our next elections because some people are demo ##ral ##ized by terrorism and lack the will to participate in politics , which makes the election results un ##sat ##is ##factory .
