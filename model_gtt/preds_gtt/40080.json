  "doctext": "it was barely noon when a man who had just arrived on a flight from med ##elli ##n went into the national bookstore to buy some newspapers . meanwhile , his bodyguard - cha ##uf ##fe ##ur waited for him in the lobby . the man with the newspapers , a cattle ##man named gustavo de jesus es ##co ##bar fernandez , had just left the bookstore when the trouble started . es ##co ##bar was preparing to go to his car when a man approached him . the man , around 35 years old and 5 feet 9 inches tall , took out a 7 . 65 caliber pistol and began firing . panic spread throughout the terminal as people threw themselves on the floor to avoid being shot . es ##co ##bar immediately fell to the floor as his attacker tried to escape through one of the exits . apparently , he did not take into account the presence of the bodyguard , who had enough time to draw his gun and shoot the ag ##gre ##sso ##r , who died at the scene . es ##co ##bar fernandez was taken to the san pedro cl ##aver clinic , where he was pronounced dead on arrival . but the tragic event did not end there . a 20 - year - old woman who was at the airport , maria fl ##ore ##z gutierrez , was seriously wounded and her condition was listed as serious when this edition went to print . early details did not clarify the motivation for the attack . according to documents found in his clothing , in addition to his activities as a cattle ##man , gustavo de jesus es ##co ##bar was a legal advisor in congress , although this was denied by spoke ##sm ##en from that institution . things took another turn that evening , when the television news program 24 hours reported that es ##co ##bar fernandez was the cousin of pablo es ##co ##bar ga ##vir ##ia . this gave rise to the su ##pp ##osition that the attack was linked to the series of killings in the so - called \" cartel war . \" as to the attacker , neither his real motives nor his identity were known at the end of the week .
