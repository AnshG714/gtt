{"doctext": "dear mr president : on the road toward achieving peace , we have often experienced set ##backs and difficult times . powerful forces are trying to justify violence and war every time diplomatic channels or commitments are not followed or met . when there is an armed struggle and when thousands are killed on the battlefield , those who promote violence never conclude from those useless killings that war is futile . they do not believe that peace can be achieved through dialogue and negotiation . it will always be easier to rec ##tify mistakes when the weaknesses are political or when errors are made on the road to peace . we cannot bring the dead back to life , and violence born of hatred takes a long time to heal . i believe , mr president , that it would be encouraging if you were to rec ##tify some political decisions your government made following the unfortunate incidents at nan ##dai ##me . it is important to re ##open the communications media that are closed . it is necessary to release the prisoners and to rev ##oke the sentences imposed upon them as punishment for involvement in those incidents . the peace plan to which we are committed ob ##li ##ges us to restore confidence as soon as possible . our most sacred commitment is to continue progressing on the path toward democrat ##ization . it is imperative that your government and the nicaragua ##n contra ##s resume negotiations to secure a permanent end to military actions in nicaragua . this could very well be an encouraging example for many central american and other countries . i offer you our costa rican territory for the res ##ump ##tion of such negotiations . i also offer you all the assistance within my means to enable such negotiations to take place . i understand that you will attend the upcoming inaugural ceremony in ecuador . i believe it would be a sign of confidence in the future of peace , a noble gesture toward rodrigo bo ##r ##ja , and would aid in strengthening the ecuador ##an democratic process if you attended the ceremony in quit ##o after rev ##ers ##ing the set ##backs incurred as a result of anti ##de ##mo ##cratic actions , such as penal ##izing the communications media and de ##pr ##iving men and women of their liberty . only if we have the strength to correct our mistakes and the vision to continue on the path outlined in the peace plan can central americans prevent the con ##tin ##uance of the armed aggression against our peoples . a latin american commitment to peace also requires efforts to achieve independence and democracy . we will not be granted another political opportunity to forge history . it is unlikely that there will be a new opportunity for reconciliation to allow today ' s youth a different future , a new opportunity to put aside their weapons and to work for a better future .", "pred_seq": "[CLS]", "pred_templates": [], "gold_templates": [], "docid": "40011"}
