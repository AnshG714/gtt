  "doctext": "i have been working jointly with the armed forces general staff - - not just this week but for several months . i have to add that not only the national police are involved , but the public security forces and the military corps stationed here in san salvador . we have reinforcements from the countryside and are working on a joint plan to help minimize terrorist attacks that they will try to carry out and are carrying out at this very moment . just to give you an example , right now we are waiting for a demonstration that is to begin at the national university . there will be students together with un ##ts ( national union of salvador ##an workers ) members , who are going to march their usual route and end up at the park across from the cathedral . i want to tell you that they are not going to have any problems as long as they obey the law . as i said a few days ago , we do not want confrontation ##s with anyone . what they want is to confront police and public security forces for the sake of creating a martyr , and we are unwilling to ob ##li ##ge them in this endeavor . ( passage omitted ) ( reporter ) the attack against the national guard seems like a campaign against the security corps . we would like to know if the national police are on alert for an attack in view of the attacks against the national guard and the treasury police ? ( guzman ) as i said before , this is not new for us , and we are making plans . you notice that the general headquarters is close to homes . we have already seen in us ##ulu ##tan and in san francisco mora ##zan where these people attacked without caring whether they destroyed private property or homes - - even killing innocent civilians . we are not exempt from this here . we have a strategy . we even believe there is a possibility of an attack from inside the general headquarters - - it is very possible , they have done it before . i remember when they bombed the service station here , destroying three or four vehicles , and they also placed bombs inside the general directorate office . we are doing all we can to try to avoid these problems . we are ready to face any situation . ( passage omitted ) ( reporter ) what plans have you made for the upcoming o ##as general meeting , and what security responsibilities will the national police have in regard to this meeting ? ( guzman ) you must understand these are mainly military plans which we cannot very well disclose in advance . if i started giving out this information , i would be exposing our security operation for the meeting . all i can say is that we are taking this situation very seriously . we have reinforcements from the countryside . not only is the national police involved , but the public security corps , as well as other units that have come from the countryside to support this common effort .
