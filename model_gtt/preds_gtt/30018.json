( begin recording ) ( unidentified military officer ) the guerrillas used 60 - mm mortar ##s and rpg - 18 rocket launcher ##s . the terrorists traveled in cars . they destroyed several power poles on 29th street and machine ##gun ##ned several transformers . the attack came mainly from the south , where the co ##ha ##che organization is located , and from the hon ##du ##a church here . they also attacked from the northeast , but most of the attackers came from the direction of the national university , firing from there at some ( word ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) we have in the area . we had removed the cord ##on around the university 4 or 5 days ago , and ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) fired from there . the wounded include at least three civilians , one of whom is in serious condition and has already been taken by our troops to the military hospital ; perhaps five traffic policemen , although this has not been confirmed ; and a soldier of the bell ##oso battalion . no damage was caused here at the garrison . only a few shells hit the garrison , and these were 60 - mm mortar shells , which are not powerful enough to cause damage . we found six ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) . as for the rpg ' s , we found only one ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) behind the ant ##el ( national administration for telecommunications ) office ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) . we found six holes from m - 79 shells , but they did not cause great damage . one of our civilian employees came out slightly wounded from the ( word ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) . ( reporter ) colonel , our country will have a new president in a few days . the fm ##ln has called a new transportation stop ##page beginning on 31 may and has now attacked the 1st brigade . based on this evidence , do you feel the fm ##ln will int ##ens ##ify its military actions in san salvador ? ( military officer ) of course , we are expecting this . channel 12 has already reported that a transportation stop ##page will begin on 31 may . therefore , we believe vi ##gil ##ance must be increased . we expected this kind of attack . we have always said we are prepared to rep ##el any terrorist attack , and this was a typical terrorist attack . from a military stand ##point , i do not think the attack was very effective . the guerrillas used mortar ##s but mostly hurt civilians .
