( end recording ) in reply to these statements by president ce ##re ##zo , the u . s . embassy pointed out in its com ##mun ##ique of 6 march that the u . s . government had supported the esq ##ui ##pu ##las ii peace process from the very beginning . it added that ever since the signing of the esq ##ui ##pu ##las accord , guatemala has received $ 600 million in u . s . aid . this shows , according to the embassy , that u . s . support for guatemala ##n democracy continued to be strong after the signing of the esq ##ui ##pu ##las ii document . in any case , from president ce ##re ##zo ' s perspective the u . s . attitude in this situation reflects the traditional inclination of that country ' s governments throughout history to di ##cta ##te rules to other nations regarding what they should do . ce ##re ##zo compared guatemala ' s situation in matters of criminal investigation to the situation in several u . s . cities where the police are unable to control crime . as an example , he cited washington , d . c . , where assaults , murders , and crimes frequently related to drug consumption have reached very astonishing levels in the past few years . as for the departure of ambassador st ##rook , ce ##re ##zo said that the diplomat has not been withdrawn from guatemala , but returned to the united states for consultation ##s by order of the state department . in statements made minutes after receiving the credentials of the new fr ##g ambassador , however , ce ##re ##zo said that his return was , to a certain extent , due to a decision we made .",
