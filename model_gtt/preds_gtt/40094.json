  "doctext": "the peruvian governing party , apr ##a , today ended a conflict ##ive party congress on a note of defeat for president alan garcia , and with the emergence of former prime minister luis al ##va castro as new party leader . the apr ##a congress eliminated the post of party president , which was created for alan garcia in 1985 , con ##sol ##ida ##ting his position as party leader following a decisive victory in the presidential election of that year . according to some critics within the party , the personal ##ism that had characterized garcia ' s und ##is ##puted leadership since 1982 was thus ended . luis al ##va castro , 46 , former prime minister and economy minister as well as former president of the chamber of deputies , was elected by a large margin as the new secretary general , a post which regained the highest status in the party . al ##va castro capital ##ized on the internal di ##ssi ##den ##ce and on the party ' s di ##sen ##chan ##tment with alan garcia as a result of the deterioration of the social and economic situation , which is considered the worst crisis in this century and is blamed on the chief of state ' s \" stubborn ##ness \" in not changing his nationalist ##ic and pop ##uli ##st policy line . \" the new cad ##re elected at the 16th apr ##a congress is in favor of a \" change in orientation \" in the party ' s management and in the public administration for the remaining 18 months of the apr ##a ' s term in office . it is expected that alan garcia and al ##va castro may reach an agreement on the way the government should be run until 1990 , when the current presidential term will end following new general elections . garcia also lost the presidency of the political commission that sets the party ' s political line . this post was won by luis alberto sanchez , 88 , first vice president of the nation and one of the main ##sp ##ring ##s in the change ##over operation within the apr ##a . the other elect ##ive positions were filled with apr ##a members who do not follow garcia ' s line . thus , the presence of alan garcia within the party was reduced to being member of the political commission in his capacity as former party secretary general . two days ago , the peruvian chief of state resigned the apr ##a presidency , upset over criticism directed at him during the opening of the party congress . he thus responded to obvious signs that the party president post would be eliminated . the apr ##a had thought alan garcia would be a very capable heir to victor raul hay ##a de la torre , the party ' s founder and historical leader , who died in 1979 . three and one - half years after garcia ' s election victory , the party disqualified garcia for the role of hay ##a de la torre ' s successor because of his errors and his failure to rec ##tify his government line . following the tradition initiated by alan garcia , new apr ##a leader luis al ##va castro will be sworn in as secretary general this coming friday before the tomb of hay ##a de la torre in the northern city of tr ##uj ##illo , the apr ##a ' s main bastion . the economic crisis , marked by 2 , 000 - percent inflation and a 20 - percent recession from october 1987 to october 1988 , is compound ##ed by social instability and political violence , with killings averaging four per day . an internal political storm hit the apr ##a 16th national congress , and vice president sanchez said that he cannot recall anything similar . during the last session of the congress , three youths were injured in a melee among apr ##a people . other party members were hit on the head with handgun butt ##s , and three news ##men - - who had not been allowed to attend the proceedings of the congress - - were attacked .",
