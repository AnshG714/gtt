  "doctext": "mr president , one of the topics to be discussed deals with the far ##ab ##und ##o mart ##i national liberation front ( fm ##ln ) . ( az ##cona ) i believe that at this summit the central ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) . ( reporter ) how , mr president ? ( az ##cona ) well , i do not know . it is not easy to solve this problem . none of the problems will be easy to solve . ( reporter ) is there a possibility for dialogue ? ( az ##cona ) yes , but the nicaragua ##n government would also have to hold a dialogue with the nicaragua ##n resistance . ( reporter ) i am the vo ##z de nicaragua reporter . what is your opinion of the agreement reached by the nicaragua ##n government with the political parties ? ( az ##cona ) well , i read the agreement last night and believe it to be a step forward . incident ##ally , i read it twice last night and it is a very long document . i am talking about the agreement with the parties that are truly opposition parties and not the one made with the other parties because these are not really opposition parties . ( reporter ) what i wanted was your opinion on the demo ##bil ##ization of the contra ##s from honduras . ( az ##cona ) oh , you are talking about the small document that makes demands , demands , and more demands . this document has no value . ( reporter ) i mean the document signed with the 21 political parties . . . ( az ##cona , interrupting ) that agreement is valuable but it does not mention the contra demo ##bil ##ization . the document states that the nicaragua ##n government and the opposition parties agree that the esq ##ui ##pu ##las ii and costa del sol agreements should be ab ##ided by . this is the document i read twice , and i believe it is quite serious and a step forward . ( reporter ) what will you do to get the mercenaries to leave your country ? ( az ##cona ) first , i do not use der ##oga ##tory terms . they are nicaragua ##ns who for different reasons disagree with the system in nicaragua . these nicaragua ##ns oppose the system , and for this and other reasons they have taken up arms against the system and have taken refuge in honduras . i do not use the term mercenary . i understand the nicaragua ##n government uses it and it is all right for them to do so , but i will not answer a question that uses a term that i believe is too der ##oga ##tory . ( reporter ) the demo ##bil ##ization plan has a very firm deadline and is to be completed within 90 days . do you think . . . ( az ##cona , interrupting ) no , no . the 90 - day deadline is included in an agreement signed by nicaragua ##n president ortega with three small nicaragua ##n leftist parties . i do not believe this document is very important . i do believe , however , that the agreement signed by the nicaragua ##n president and the opposition parties is important because it is based on the esq ##ui ##pu ##las ii and costa del sol agreements . ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) terrorists in el salvador and contra ##s are presently not active , so both situations - - contra ##s and guerrillas - - are different . ( reporter ) is it true that president cr ##ist ##iani is going to present a parallel program at the summit ? ( az ##cona ) ( words ind ##ist ##in ##ct ) president cr ##ist ##iani comes to the summit as el salvador ' s legitimate president . he has the right to present his points of view . he has the right to contribute to the solution of problems in other countries as well as to ones in his own country . ( reporter ) is there a possibility that a demo ##bil ##ization plan for the salvador ##an guerrillas will be studied at this summit if president cristina ##i presents one ? ( az ##cona ) of course . he has a right to do so . ( continued )",
