  "doctext": "concerning the prospects for the dialogue - negotiation based on the mediation of un secretary general javier perez de cue ##llar and the debate in the u . s . congress on the aid to el salvador , the far ##ab ##und ##o mart ##i national liberation front ( fm ##ln ) reports : 1 . we have viewed with great concern the government and army ' s rejection mr perez de cue ##llar ' s participation in the dialogue - negotiation process as a media ##tor . this attitude is an obstacle to a process that could facilitate the negotiation effort . on our part , we have accepted this mediation and we have undertaken efforts to achieve it . 2 . the state of siege , the assassination of social democratic leader hector o ##quel ##i , the doubtful and insufficient initial results in the case of the jesuit priests , the absence of conditions for the political activity of the opposition , the continuation of the persecution of churches , and the lack of freedom of speech through the direct or covert gag ##ging of the press show that cr ##ist ##iani ' s government is carrying out a policy of confrontation with all the country ' s social and political forces . for this reason , the terms of the dialogue - negotiation must be re ##ori ##ented so that it will be turned into a national process with the participation of all those forces . 3 . we view as gravely er ##rone ##ous the persistence of a government policy based on the idea of the fm ##ln ' s alleged military weakness . this position , similar to the one that was put forth prior to 11 november ( date of the beginning of the fm ##ln military offensive ) will only lead the country to greater levels of confrontation . 4 . we re ##af ##firm our willingness to hold the meeting of both sides with the un secretary general soon . we hope that mr cr ##ist ##iani ' s visit to the united nations will lead to such a meeting and that we can agree with the media ##tor on the date to hold it . 5 . we believe that the u . s . aid to the salvador ##an government is directed against democrat ##ization and a political solution . the sending of signals to one or another sector of the government or army , using the pressure of setting conditions or threatening the end of aid , does not resolve the problem . we believe the members of the u . s . congress can make an important contribution to end the war in our country by agreeing to suspend that aid , something which could form part of a negotiated agreement that would simultaneously en ##tail a cease - fire .
