  "doctext": "smart ##ly dressed and speaking in nearly perfect english , salvador ##an president alfredo cr ##ist ##iani has again visited the united states , where he tried to appear at the congress and the united nations as a statesman aware of his rights . this is , however , a critical moment for the salvador ##an president , and he knows it . but this point was also stressed by the large numbers of people who boo ##ed him at nearly every large u . s . city he visited . although the ghosts of the assassinated jesuits shadowed him all during his tour , the arena ( nationalist republican alliance ) representative , just as his predecessor jose napoleon du ##arte did , flew to the united states to try to convince the legislators , particularly the democrats , that he intends to resume the dialogue for peace and check the army ' s criminal aspirations . waving the human rights flag has been the most important thing for cr ##ist ##iani , particularly because he is aware that with this action he can continue to receive washington ' s financial support for his government . according to to some experts , cr ##ist ##iani went farther than his predecessor . he asked the un secretary general to help in the res ##ump ##tion of talks with the guerrillas , replaced several military officers of doubtful reputation , and assured he will punish severely eight soldiers accused of assassin ##ating the six jesuit priests . we must keep in mind that , prior to his trip , the salvador ##an president succeeded in curb ##ing a coup attempt staged by army reaction ##ary groups . members of the salvador ##an opposition have coincided in the ##r view that never before had a head of state challenged the military hierarchy to such an extent , a hierarchy that opposes all negotiation with the guerrillas . the experts also said , however , that the country ' s internal situation has never been so serious . the rebel offensive launched in november is a landmark , after which everything will be different in el salvador , beginning with the government party , which was left in a very delicate situation in the eyes of influential u . s . power circles . the guerrilla drive also demonstrated that only two alternatives are left for the country . if serious peace negotiations are not initiated , the counter ##ins ##urg ##ency policy will be aggravated . this could even give the united states a pre ##text to intervene directly in the country . although president george bush said he would continue to aid el salvador , a large number of legislators for a long time have been questioning what use has been nearly $ 4 billion delivered to the salvador ##an army in 10 years of war . if for the white house the alternative is to continue to give military aid to el salvador or resign itself to an eventual victory of the rebels , for cr ##ist ##iani the situation is even more difficult because , to get more money , he must ensure that human rights are respected . this is equivalent to influencing the most reaction ##ary military officers and guarantee ##ing the fulfillment of the famous economic recovery plan advocated by his party . these points are nearly impossible to comply with in a country immersed in war . if the economy is weak , respect for human rights is even weaker . anyway , the u . s . government is planning to increase aid for the salvador ##an government . this contributes to putting far into the distance any plans to end the war .",
