  "doctext": "today luis caceres, ucr secretary general and a national deputy, promised chilean radical party (pr) leader ricardo navarrete that a delegation of ucr leaders will be sent to observe the plebiscite that will decide chile's institutional future in early october 1988.    during a news conference held with the chilean pr leader, who said (words indistinct) that an opinion contrary to the continuation of general augusto pinochet as chilean president will prevail in the plebiscite.    the no vote will win because chileans are fed up with the past 15 years of suffering, including torture, killings, and humiliation, said navarrete. he added that the opposition will monitor the balloting, thus safeguarding the plebiscite from any fraudulent actions.    on 30 august, the top authorities in the chilean regime will nominate their candidate--it is taken for granted that it will be pinochet--so that the citizenry can vote yes or no in the plebiscite, thus deciding whether this candidate will govern the country for the next 9 years.    navarrete added that after the victory of the no vote, the opposition will ask for another plebiscite in order to ammend the constitution promulgated by the current regime in 1980 so as to ensure a call for democratic, free, and open general elections. nevertheless, navarrete noted: if we are defeated honestly, we will respect the plebiscite's outcome, although we will continue to struggle.",
