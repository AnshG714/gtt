(end recording)    vice president merino also referred to another topic in the news, the antiterrorist law:    (begin recording) (merino) we understand the bill has already been sent to the national assembly.  there is (words indistinct) for the defense of democracy, and another one that refers to the antiterrorist law.  the truth is that the executive branch has been quite clear in its position, which was stated by the vice presidency.    the executive branch has clearly stated it cannot let these people continue operating without restrictions or controls, violating the law, disrupting social life, and directly affecting the (words indistinct).  the government and the people must be protected by effective laws so the public security forces can control the situation and so their activities are not interpreted as an abuse of authority.

(reporter) it is rumored that the law (passage indistinct).      (merino) the provisions already exist; all we have to do is harmonize them.  we must fulfill our obligation.  the constitution (words indistinct) stated that every secondary law should be harmonized with the constitution.  in this case, the penal code, the provisions have been neglected to a certain point, and it is imperative -- if we are going to abide by the constitution -- to adapt them to our situation.  (words indistinct) salvadoran people and no official of a friendly country can interfere with this.    i recently told some journalists who are my friends that vice president quayle's goal was to come and reaffirm his government's support of the new salvadoran government.  he did it on this date because on 1 june he was in charge of the u.s. presidency while president bush was in europe.  his visit to el salvador was not a mere coincidence.  he came to reaffirm the u.s. government's support of president cristiani's government.
