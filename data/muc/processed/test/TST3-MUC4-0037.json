  "doctext": "two persons were injured in dynamite attacks perpetrated this evening against two bank branches in this northwestern colombian city.    the first police reports indicate that a bomb exploded in front of the state-owned agrarian board in the suburbs of manrique, and another at the agrarian board branch in the sector of aranjuez.    one person was seriously wounded in each of the terrorist attacks, but no deaths were reported.    the device which exploded in manrique destroyed the bank building and a bus that was parked in front of the building, and caused considerable damage in several stores nearby.    the explosion in the other branch was of a lesser magnitude, and it broke windows and caused damage inside the offices.    the scant police information said that the devices were apparently left in front of the two bank branches minutes before the curfew began for the 6th consecutive day--precisely to counter the wave of terrorism caused by drug traffickers.    these represent the second and third dynamite attacks in medellin this evening. the previous one took place 2 hours earlier and blew up a police post, but failed to injure its five occupants.",
