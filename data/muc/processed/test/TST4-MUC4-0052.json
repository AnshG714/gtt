  "doctext": "the movement of the revolutionary left (mir) has decided that in the next few months it will carry out \"a struggle of the masses\" to destabilize the military regime by \"all forms of struggle.\" the mir rejected the strategy of dialogue advocated by the opposition's democratic sectors.    the mir added that it will \"take advantage of any situation\" and that it will use the electoral process by registering a leftist party.    mir spokesman jecar neghme talked to the press yesterday about the resolutions approved at the latest mir central committee meeting held on 6 and 7 november.  he said that it was the first meeting held in chile since july 1973.    neghme stated that in addition to political issues, the central committee also paid homage to raul pellegrin and cecilia magni, members of the manuel rodriguez patriotic front who were killed recently.    in a public communique, the mir criticized the opposition parties for \"not listening to the national clamor for pinochet's resignation\" and for giving priority to \"a strategy of shady deals at the top level.\"    the communique adds: \"although the document released by the 16 political parties focuses on some of the people's demands, its main defect is that by including the demands as part of a negotiating strategy and by making the mobilization tasks unclear, the demands of the chilean people will not be heard.\"    the mir also said that next year it will struggle for the immediate end of the regime and the constitution, the creation of a provisional government, the election of a constituent assembly, the strengthening of the united left, and the preparation of a \"democratic and popular program\" for the country.    the communique says that to achieve those goals the mir will promote a tactic \"to destabilize the regime, to make the institutions illegitimate, to democratize the country, and to accumulate greater force.\"    the communique also points out that the mir will use \"the limited possibility of participating in elections beginning in 1988.\" this is why the mir supports the registration of a leftist party: to prevent the exclusion of the left and \"to promote the gains of the people.\"",
